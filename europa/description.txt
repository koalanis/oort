Description:
	In this game, two balls bounces around a hollow cube.

Controls:	

	You can use 'wasd' to control the position of the camera and use 
	the mouse to control the pitch and yaw of the camera. You can also
	press shift to increase speed of the camera's movement.

Software Design:
	Collision is handled with a ray tracing heuristic.
	The ball only checks collision with planes that are in its path, rather than checking against all the planes in the scene. This can be inaccurate though, for velocities that hit the planes at a very small angle. To handle this, I also check a ball's position against the plane's, to ensure that the collision detection is not done late.
